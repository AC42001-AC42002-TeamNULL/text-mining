Exercise 3
In a rules-based approach to argument mining, we aim to extrapolate information about an argument based upon rules we know about arguments, such as how they are structured.
The most prominent advantage of a rule-based approach in argument mining is that rule-based approaches are typically able to provide strong results when fine-tuned to a very specific domain. Thus, when we find a rule that applies to a vast majority of arguments, we can utilise this to capture a very large amount of arguments. The disadvantage of this however is that we may require many rules in order to filter out other pieces of discourse for which those rules also apply.
Another advantage is that rules-based approaches can be performed in an unsupervised manner, with the rules doing all the work without requiring any time-consuming prior labelling of the data. However, a lot of time effort will still be expended implementing and fine-tweaking rules.
The greatest limitation to the rules-based approach is its lack of flexibility compared to other approaches such as semi-supervised or unsupervised machine learning. A machine learning based argument miner may become very accurate and possibly surpass a rules-based approach when exposed to a large amount of training examples, and may draw on examples from many domains giving the approach a total underlying understanding of rules without the fine-tuning and research requirement of a rules based approach.
