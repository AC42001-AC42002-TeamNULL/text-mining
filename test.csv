However  we should have to substitute å£2.7 billion of revenue a year.,0,0

of the target price.,0,0
Since the Government are embarking on a brainwashing national exercise to persuade us that we are on the brink of a marvellous  prosperous era  does the Secretary of State not think it appropriate to allow the teachers of Scotland a share of that prosperity by setting up an independent review board?,1,2

Member for Woolwich (Mr. Cartwright) on question No. 3  and the relationship that Germany must have to that  in the review that is being carried forward will he press the Americans to set a level for the troop requirements in Europe in conjunction with General Galvin and ourselves  as it is essential that we should be able to give a lead to the rest of NATO on what we believe is necessary for the proper defence of Europe even after the conventional force reduction treaties?,0,0

I agree that it is easy to point to the faults in the present system.,0,0

Is my hon. Friend aware that I should not be content with anything less than the full answer that he gave me about a man who was released from Park Lane nearly six months ago and has now been recalled?,0,0
During the time that matter was before the tribunal  a question was asked by the hon. Member for Barnsley  East and I answered it on 9 April 1984 stating categorically the Home Secretary's view that the man was not fit to be released.,0,0
Since the right hon. Gentleman has responded to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) by drawing attention to the question of harmonisation  why is it that the Prime Minister traipses from international conference to international conference seeking to wreck harmonisation?,1,2

Is my hon. Friend aware that if tractors and cars were sold in this country at the prices at which they are available abroad  there would be a great increase in the home use of British made tractors and cars?,0,0
The answer to the last part of that supplementary question is that I fancy that some of my colleagues who attended that occasion are not in the habit of seeking the blessing of Her Majesty's Government  silent or otherwise  and seem able to speak and act for themselves.,0,0
Is it not extraordinary that the galley proofs were available at the end of May but that we still do not have the report at the end of July?,0,0

This underlines the importance of the proposals made by British Rail to the unions  and the importance of their being accepted.,0,0
I accept that the Social Security (No. 2) Bill represents a sensible allocation of priorities in difficult circumstances  but will my right hon. Friend assure the House that it is the Government's firm intention  as soon as resources become available  to resume progress in providing both cash benefits and services for the disabled?,0,0
labour.,0,0

I understand and share my hon. Friend's point of view.,1,1
The M25 has reduced lorry mileage in London by over 20 per cent and it has reduced the number of lorries on some major roads by 40 per cent The lorry ban exercise has included 2 000 signs  20 000 permits and 200 000 pages of application forms.,0,0
I say again that we shall do all that we sensibly can to encourage the process of dialogue to renew and to encourage the leaders of both communities to come to those talks in a spirit of good will  determined to reach an agreed settlement.,0,0
We deplored and deeply regretted the loss of life involved  and I summoned the South African ambassador immediately to see me and made clear the serious view that we took of that attack.,0,0
Secondly  does he agree that one of the Government's objectives ought to be a recession clause in the MFA  whereby the capacity of this country to absorb imports was related to the strength of domestic purchasing power?,0,0
However  whichever company gains the contract it will mean jobs for British industry åùand I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that.,0,0
Does the right hon. Gentleman recall that prior to the last general election the present Prime Minister paraded up and down the country giving an assurance that a Conservative Government would abolish the system of local rating because of its inequities and anomalies?,1,2
That is the reality.,0,0
May I ask that Tory candidate if he will guaranteeÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂåùÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂåù  On a point of order  Mr. SpeakerÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂåùÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂåù  Order.,0,0
There is nothing in the Commission decision that casts doubt on that approach.,0,0
To our knowledge  a few people are left  including one Briton who has chosen to remain  and about 30 other non New Hebrideans.,0,0
What he says is not true.,1,2
My right hon. Friend is still considering the future level of the revaluation rate rebates  which affect both domestic and commercial ratepayers.,0,0

"As regular check ups are so much a part of private medicine  may I assume from the words ""health promotion"" that my right hon. Friend is now extending that service to the National Health Service so that the ""fit person"" medical will become part and parcel of the health of this country?",0,0
How long will it last?,0,0
Therefore  we believe that there should be more majority voting  as long as the right of a member state to invoke the national interest provisions remains in a form which  while not being capable of abuse  protects national interest.,0,0
Is it not sound policy that British Rail should exploit to the full the commercial potential of its existing assets?,0,0
I have discussed this matter with the chairman  and my hon. Friend the Under Secretary is continuing to pursue it.,0,0
It is an attractive recommendation  but I think that it is important to consult properly on the implications before we start making announcements.,0,0
No such offer has yet been made.,0,0

The documentary evidence was presented to us only on Tuesday  although we received one paper on Monday.,0,0

It depends heavily upon exports for most of its business.,0,0
It is a gross insult to the House to publish the report in a dummy form.,0,0
The implementation of the Act cannot come soon enough to bring that relief to Scottish ratepayers.,0,0
We now have net assets overseas worth å£42 billion  as opposed to å£10 billion in 1978  which are already producing net portfolio remittances of about å£ 1.6 billion a year  as opposed to å£400 million a year in 1978.,0,0
In addition to trying to bring the 200 000 litre men up to full strength  will my right hon. Friend change his mind and attempt to find some quota for those small farmers who will have no livelihood unless they get some quota for 1985 86?,0,0
Will he assure us that there shall be no large payment or amnesty to IRA murderers  no matter what information they are prepared to sell to the Royal Ulster Constabulary?,0,0
I also agree with my hon. Friend that the GLC's entire propanganda campaign is founded upon a falsehood  in that it does not pay any attention to the 32 London boroughs and the City of London  which will inherit the vast majority of services which will be devolved from it.,1,1
The reduction of those levels is the top priority of the Government.,0,0
Finally  will the Secretary of State retrieve the position  at least a little  by agreeing now to make a definitive statement on the report in the first week that the House comes back from the recess?,0,0
We are now trying to supplement that by adding to the promotion of good health and the prevention of ill health.,0,0
I have frequently made clear most recently in my discussions on 5 October with Ministers of the Irish Republic the Government's concern that those who commit terrorist crimes in Northern Ireland and flee to the Republic should be brought to justice.,0,0
One of our economic problems is not so much the shortage of demand for British goods as their shortage of supply.,0,0
There is increasing evidence that they are and that milk supplies are coming down in other countries.,0,0
It is significant that the leaders of the industry have accepted the Government's assurances,1,1
Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the golden share in Enterprise 16 Oil has a life of five years?,0,0
I am advised by the British Theatre Association that it has nearly 300 000 texts in its library.,0,0
It is solely for the responsible authorities in the Republic to determine whether charges should be brought  as would be the case in this country in similar circumstances.,0,0
I am sure that I can give my hon. Friend that assurance.,0,0
It would be for the Assembly to decide what powers should be transferred to it and to make recommendations to the House.,0,0
It is no secret that we think that it would be better if the President of Cyprus did not visit Bulgaria.,0,0
The question  therefore  does not arise.,0,0
Will she arrange for a signed copy to be sent to our right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath)?,0,0
It would be entirely foolish for us to accept such prescriptions and to follow the right hon. Gentleman in the opposite direction.,1,2
Will she now go ahead and legislate on doorstep selling and tell the EEC Commission what it can do with its directive?,0,0
Will the Minister consider urging one of those Thames authorities  namely  South East Thames in the interests of efficiency and of increasing its income  on which expenditure depends urgently to start realising the income from the numerous empty properties throughout the region for which it has no further use?,0,0
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Services what is the percentage change in expenditure on hospital and community health services in real terms  respectively  using the National Health Service pay and prices deflator  in the four Thames regional health authorities in total  between 1981 82 and the most recent year for which figures are available.,0,0
in the United Kingdom.,0,0
The Government have taken no decision to alter that provision relating to nursery education.,0,0
While supporting the question by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike)  and notwithstanding the earlier reply by the right hon.

How many are on transitional protection and will thus have no increase in their benefits this April?,0,0
Meanwhile  however  I have asked authorities not to enter into any further new housing commitments except those which follow from a statutory obligation.,0,0

In May 1990 the unemployment rate in north Wales stood at 5.7 per cent  whereas four years ago it was 15.2 per cent The rate in Clwyd is 4.9 per cent whereas it was 14.7 per cent four years ago.,0,0
Accordingly  urgent consideration is being given to the programme of legislation which would be needed to provide a modern body of insolvency law.,0,0
As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware  negotiations with the EEC on the doorstep selling directive have been extremely prolonged because of the difficulties that we have encountered in the way in which it cuts 20 across British law  which we feel is more effective.,0,0
I shall certainly talk to the chairman about the points that the hon. Gentleman makes.,0,0
However  those who appreciate the necessity of recognising that we are in the 20th century but who nevertheless wish to preserve these elements of the past feel that this solution  which Imry has further considered and to which it is making a contribution of some å£10 million  is one that we should support.,0,0
Taking this into account  the purchasing power of the Thames regions rose in real terms by 2 per cent.  and  most important  the numbers of cases treated in all specialties rose between 1982 and 1986 by 8.7 per cent.,0,0
What is more  I am certain that the Irish Government are under no illusions as to what we think.,0,0
It is one of the factors that will be taken into account when we make our decision.,0,0
Does he agree that the real measure of growth is output  as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Dubs) said?,0,0
My answer was about 1979ÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂÅÒ80.,0,0
I have made it clear that we are looking for options for change  but we shall not rush headlong into anticipating changes before it is clear what the fundamental  irreversible changes may be.,0,0
The figures which I quoted are the average of the output  expenditure and income measures.,0,0
asked the Secretary of State for Trade what further measures he intends to introduce to improve consumer protection.,0,0
The reason is that it will cause many problems.,0,0
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will be given that task  which will be carried out this year.,0,0
Is the Minister saying that that is no longer a fact?,0,0
The NATO defensive strategy of flexible response and of forward defence has been a key element in assuring the strength of the West and it will probably see the total collapse of the Warsaw pact.,0,0
within six years and to propose to cut the Coastguard is regarded as lunatic?,0,0
I congratulate my hon. Friend on having secured his freedom.,0,0
Fourthly  the right hon. Gentleman is correct to say that Terram and sand cover the site but I believe that Imry intends concreting on top of that sand  if it has not already done so.,0,0
The appointment of an administrator was one of the important recommendations of the Cork report.,0,0
Will he do whatever he can to ensure that the scheme  which is so valuable  continues  otherwise  with the milk quota production  whole sections of the British countryside will change their character as people leave horn and find an alternative?,0,0
The demand  with which I have every sympathy  is that the site should be protected and conserved for future public inspection and remain for all time available for people to see.,0,0
The fact is that there is a sharp difference of effectiveness as between one LEA and another  both in the resources that they decide to spend and in the effectiveness of how they spend them.,0,0
It does not agree with what I am doing  but that does not mean that I am not right.,0,0
That is also an important factor,0,0
I assume that M. Dijoud can be taken at his word.,0,0
Is not there a stark contrast between the Government's behaviour in this dispute and the behaviour of the civil servants?,1,2
Before the Minister answers I remind the hon. Member and the House that we never introduce the royal family to support our arguments.,0,0
It is unthinkable that the Government could countenance a general attitude that allowed cash limits to be exceeded by about å£180 million with no attempt to do anything about it.,1,2
I do not think that the people who own the site are willing to sell it  so the hon. Gentleman has to take both sides of the bargain into account.,1,2
"Is he also awareÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂåù[HON. MEMBERS: ""Reading.""]",0,0
Will the right hon. Gentleman stand up against Mr. Powell on such issues in the same way as the 831 Chancellor is standing up against Sir Alan Walters?,0,0
Secondly  regional development grant is demand led and cannot therefore be specifically cash tagged in the way that he has suggested.,0,0
We are not in balance of payments deficit.,0,0
May I point out that it would have been more helpful if the right hon. Gentleman had read his brief?,0,0
If the hon. Gentleman wants to do his constituents a service  he will encourage northern councils to impose lower rates.,1,2

I am sure that it will be welcomed not only by disabled people  but by all members of the community.,0,0
My Department took trouble to make available to all the health correspondents of the national dailies the details of Dr. Fagin's study.,0,0
Is he further aware that the right hon. Lady gave the impression that the matter was urgent?,1,2
However  they should give credit to our forces  especially during the past few days  when they have suffered severe casualties  for the fact that they have had enormous successes.,0,0
in Scotland  compared with a 1 per cent.,0,0
I cannot say what future Community regimes may require.,0,0
Without notice  I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the number of people thought to be in the Irish Republic who are wanted by the RUC.,0,0
Is it not rather odd that the Opposition are calling for a Scottish Assembly  yet supporting a Welshman as their leader in Westminster?,0,0
If the Secretary of State does not urgently reconsider his decision not to reschedule  he will preserve a 10 storey office block but he will not preserve the Rose.,0,0
I had not intended to refer to the effects of the new proposals on the individual authorities.,0,0
But I shall look into what the right hon. Gentleman says.,0,0
Will he please check his information?,0,0
The right hon. Gentleman may know that there are 43 West German companies in Wales and 900 in Britain  and that one sixth of West Germany's manufacturing companies here are located in Wales.,0,0
I ask him also to keep in touch with Southwark borough council.,0,0
asked the Secretary of State for Social Services what representations he has received in the last month from outside organisations on the provisions of the Social Security (No. 2) Bill; and what steps he intends to take to satisfy their requests for amendments to the Bill.,0,0
No one should make instant comment on the report.,0,0
We have also welcomed progress towards the unification of the two German states and the freedom that the German people now have to make that decision.,0,0
As a result of advice from English Heritage  I do not feel that.,0,0
Certainly not.,0,0
Is it not time that those so called reforms were abandoned?,0,0
In the light of the disturbances last weekend in Southall and Toxteth  will the Minister seek to widen the terms of reference of the research of Dr. Harvey Brenner to include the link in the inner cities between stress  depression and unemployment?,0,0
Can he reconcile that with his intention to make house buying easier?,0,0
I am much heartened by my right hon and learned Friend's remarks and I am grateful to him.,0,0
Will not those groups have to be subsidised by the ratepayers or the taxpayers?,0,0
If the hon. Lady studies the statement that M. Dijoud made with me yesterday  she will find that it is a very strong statement.,1,2
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reply.,0,0
I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his bold and imaginative statement  which was long overdue.,1,1
I have taken the same view as my colleague  M. Dijoud  namely  that for the time being the right course is to press both sides for further negotiations.,0,0
Right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Benches very much appreciate the way in which so many members of the Labour party have been round in their condemnation of the appalling act of terrorism at Brighton.,1,1
The major reduction in public investment in housing took place under a Labour  not a Conservative Government  and the hon. Gentleman's statistics ignore the recovery in the private housebuilding sector  which meets real housing needs.,1,2
"Are we not about to see  next month  a new form of gerrymander  the ""Ridleymander""  which is buying votes in the places where the right hon. Gentleman knows that his friends would otherwise lose seats because of the system set up under statute in 1980?",1,2
If  after reconsidering the policy  he still declines to comment  will he urge the controlling power to consider the matter and to make a statement on it?,1,2
The tractor ouput of this country is no thanks to Her Majesty's Government or the Minister.,1,2
On a point of order  Mr. Speaker.,0,0
If the hon. Gentleman is presenting himself to the House  and perhaps to Western Europe  as the last unreformed Stalinist who wants to defend this policy  I do not think that he will find many of his hon. Friends with him on that matter.,1,2
May I say how pleased I am that my right hon. Friend has come forward with a scheme that is practical and that brings together the parties  the developers  the London borough of Southwark  English Heritage  the museum of London and those of us who wish the site to be made available and accessible and 1124 preserved for posterity.,0,0
The way forward on that is now clear.,0,0
We look forward to receiving its report as soon as possible.,0,0
Will he come clean and tell the House at what level he will set the GREA?,1,2
That is what I am seeking.,0,0
However  I think that these proposals are substantial and go as far as we should go.,0,0
While I note that reply  is the Minister aware that President Vassiliou's efforts in seeking to unite the island of Cyprus have sadly come to nothing?,0,0
Why have these allegedly bright ideas not been available to right hon. and hon. Members  certainly up until yesterday?,0,0
The hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) has himself been urging that there should be an inquiry into the system of local government finance.,0,0
Does the Minister recognise that probably the Government's greatest social crime is that since 1979 housing expenditure has been slashed by very nearly half?,1,2
The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that there was any deliberate sale of equipment to South Africa.,1,2
asked the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations Her Majesty's Government have received on the continuing imprisonment of Nelson Mandela in South Africa; and what has been the response of those representations.,0,0
If it is under threat  I shall reconsider the position.,0,0
When the Foreign Secretary this afternoon meets the President of SWAPO  Mr. Sam Nujoma  will he tell him two things?,0,0
I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has read the important new statement on his party's defence policy  which is accompanied by the statement that The Labour leadership is anxious to avoid supporters being stampeded into demands for deep cuts in defence.,1,2
The Government are strongly committed to the library system.,1,1
As I said in the debates on clause 4 of the Bill  if  after the earnings related benefit has been phased out under the Bill  additional resources become available for the improvement of social security generally  a decision will have to be taken whether those resources should be used to restore the earnings related benefit  but many people could point to higher priorities than that.,0,0
The essence of the question related to the nature of patients served.,0,0
I appreciate what my hon. Friend has said  and I am sure that he is right in stressing the importance of the collection to the drama world.,1,1
974  c. 561 2.],0,0
It was in response to representations from the Labour party  from COSLA and from others that we decided that phasing in was not appropriate for Scotland.,0,0
It will take time  as the House should understand  for our policies to check the long run decline of the economy.,0,0
While the IRA can fight elections if it wants  the ANC cannot  because it is excluded from national franchise.,0,0
I am grateful for my hon. Friend's remarks about the British authorities' actions in Port Vila in rescuing people from the island of Santo.,0,0
The latest Department of Transport information shows that at 31 December 1980 there were 45  000 tractors of all kinds in use in Scotland.,0,0

asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science what proposals he has to increase the number of nursery school places; and if he will make a statement.,0,0
In terms of industrial production and construction [Interruption.],0,0
Is he aware that such fantasies on the part of the Secretary of State or his Department have been firmly and totally rejected by the women and families of this country?,1,2
It is the wish of all political parties in Northern Ireland that there should be a devolved Administration.,0,0
I cannot give any assurance about a debate that is not a matter for me but when I was Secretary of State for Energy in 1982 and this special share was set up  I gave a pledge that if and when the share were to be redeemed  the House would be informed first.,0,0
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not now claiming that the Labour party has a mandate to govern in England.,1,2
Compared with the same period a year earlier  industrial production in Scotland from March to May 1982 was up 2 per cent  and manufacturing production was up 1.7 per cent Manufacturing output in Scotland has fallen since 1979 by 8.3 per cent  but that compares with an overall United Kingdom fall of 14.5 per cent Scotland has weathered the recession remarkably well.,0,0
Does the right hon. Gentleman also accept that he demeaned himself yesterday by involving himself in a shabby manoeuvre with the former Scottish Tory Whip in tabling a late priority written question in an effort to dodge proper qestioning on the matter?,1,2
Is the Minister aware that in a report published by the Department of Employment in Scotland last week 31 275 claimant and non claimant school leavers were registered as unemployed?,0,0
They will be subject to the system of selective rate control  for which legislation will be introduced in this Session.,0,0

With regard to his question about gas  I am sorry to see that even though the right hon. Gentleman has switched parties he is still in favour of monopoly.,1,2
I think that it is time that we thought about that.,0,0
Had we acted earlier  we could have caused a great deal of unnecessary confusion and worry to those reaching pension age before 6 July.,0,0
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging the problem of the fishermen staying in the port.,0,0
I shall look into any complaint by the hon. Gentleman.,0,0
Was not his attempt to try to sneak the information out by way of a written answer an act of political cowardice and a disgrace?,1,2
I must agree entirely with my hon. Friend about the bizarre and complex nature of the system that we seek to operate.,0,0
The most recent statistics for the rest of the Community are for December 1983.,0,0
Should not the Government call in all structure plans that seek to eat into the greenfield sites  to ensure that all the vacant  dormant and derelict land in public ownership is filled up first?,0,0
