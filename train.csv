As all the problems that we are now concerned with were ventilated in debates in this House  and  I presume  were equally well known to the French Government  how on earth have two such widely experienced colonial Powers got themselves into such an enormous mess?,0,0
It is right that we have maintained our commitment to retain the real value of the pension.,0,0
They have had to take on extra staff and to work overtime.,0,0
We must now follow the clear target that we have set  of adding years to life and quality of life to years.,0,0
I do not accept that it is the two colonial Powers that have got themselves into an enormous mess; nor would I describe the situation as an enormous mess.,0,0
Does he agree that the miners should  therefore  ignore the militant calls of Mr. Scargill and continue the expansion of their industry by opening new pits and closing old  uneconomic ones?,0,0
We have arrangements that are being discussed in Brussels at the moment  which would allow one to redistribute quota beyond the area of the dairies that were originally in the regulations.,0,0
If he does not schedule the site  I suspect that an effort will be made to seek a judicial review or an appeal to judicial process.,0,0
In this respect  I speak on behalf of all Ministers and officials who had the privilege of serving under him.,0,0
Will he say whether  in the event of peaceful demonstrations which will undoubtedly accompany the dispersal of those missiles  the security of those missiles and the policing of those demonstrations will be the responsibility of unarmed British policemen or of armed American service men?,0,0
Will he urge the Turks to use whatever leverage they have with the Turkish Cypriots to end any stalemate  urge them to come to the table on the basis of the United Nations talks and impose no preconditions?,0,0
In the negotiations in Brussels  which have not yet reached a conclusion  we always consult the representatives of the fishing industry who are with us.,0,0
In the context of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton  North (Mr. Carlisle)  is my right hon. Friend aware that there are more of us than there are of them?,1,1
As I have already made clear  the arrangements will be adequate to enable the personnel to train fully for their operational role.,0,0
However  I reassure him that the people of Leicester are sad that they have not been re rate capped.,0,0
We are meeting that need.,0,0
Should that be possible  and should we decide to pursue that route  it might provide a substantial boost to the economy of Northern Ireland.,0,0
It is essential that the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots have confidence in any settlement 829 that is eventually agreed.,0,0
My hon. Friend the Under Secretary attended the Internal Market Council and will report in detail on it.,0,0
Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman explain why he did not tell the electorate eight months ago that if a Conservative Government were elected the country would be in for three years of unparalleled austerity to quote his right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary?,1,2
Perhaps I misunderstood him.,0,0
Why is it that when he is asked about whether the MFA will be renewed  the Secretary of State always uses the phrase that the Government are committed to a successor to the MFA?,0,0
Does my hon. Friend agree that it is illogical to argue  as Opposition Members do  that the price of food should be kept down and that the farmers should not buy tractors in the cheapest market?,0,0
Everyone is sympathetic about the closure of the Singer factory  but is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the closure of British Shipbuilders' yard at Burntisland?,0,0
My ministerial colleagues will  I am sure  be reporting to the House in the usual way on the outcome of councils for which they are responsible.,0,0
When my right hon. Friend next meets the chairman  will he discuss with him the rapidly declining quality of the Aberdeen Inverness railway  which passes through my constituency  and which is of major importance to the many thousands of Service men based there and to the students who have to pursue their studies elsewhere?,0,0
Will he suggest that  if British Rail wants understanding  sympathy and support for the type of radical changes that it is proposing  it would be common sense and common courtesy to consult the Members of Parliament representing the affected areas?,0,0
Does the Secretary of State agree that the Government have had ample time to consider the report of Sir George Baker?,1,2
I have no knowledge of the number of farm workers who may or may not have lost their jobs  but I have told the House before about the arrangements to compensate those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs.,0,0
That has been confirmed to me in a letter from the Minister of State about the extent of the ownership of land on the island.,0,0
It might be useful to correct the misapprehension that the outside world might have.,0,0
He must also take into account the cost of rehabilitation which  for example  in the case of Glasgow  is estimated to be ÌÄ‰Û_Ìâå£7 000 per house.,0,0
On the second part  I understand that the Dublin Government have indicated that they wish to sign the European protocol and I hope that they will.,0,0
This year expenditure will amount to some ÌÄ‰Û_Ìâå£7.3 billion  which represents a ÌÄ‰Û_Ìâå£3.5 billion real terms increase over the 1978ÌÄå¢Ì¢‰Û_åÂÌ¢‰âÂÅÒ79 figure.,0,0
Again I stress that it is important to find a solution that is based on the best value for money and on the most viable proposition that we can find.,0,0
Surely he is being absurd in suggesting that by giving away council houses the councils are acting economically.,1,2
NACAB was without a director from April 1982 to February 1983  and it seemed wise to let the new director settle in and to review the allocation of money after six months.,0,0
That is at the heart of the problem.,0,0
I can remember discussing this matter with my hon. Friend on another occasion when I was in my previous role.,0,0
Will he find out what that was all about  and will he do something about it?,0,0
Targeting policy is therefore bound to be designed with that object in mind.,0,0
I hope that  on reflection  he will think that his questions were inappropriate.,1,2
He is looking at the capital burden on a house.,0,0
Both the variable premium scheme and the changes in the intervention system have had a beneficial effect on the market this year  in that the returns to the producers have been about 98 per cent.,0,0
I am grateful for that reply.,0,0
The first negotiating meeting with the General Medical Services Committee will take place this week on 14 January.,0,0
The sooner the shipping industry realises that the only way to halt and reverse the decline of the Merchant Navy åùwhich can be done åùis to make our Merchant Navy more competitive and to analyse those world markets where it can succeed  the better.,0,0
That way we have the best chance of success.,0,0
The wind  the rain  the frost and the sunlight will not do the ruins any good.,0,0
I find it almost impossible to reply to the right hon. Gentleman's words.,1,2
If there are any difficulties with oil  the Minister might encourage the chairman to introduce steam trains on that line  and others in Scotland.,0,0
Suffice it to say that every possible effort is being made to find a solution that secures the future of that community.,0,0
I am delighted to hear that.,0,0
He must not simply look at the original cost of constructing it.,0,0
I shall therefore call two more hon. Members from one side and one from the other.,0,0
May I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Member on his first appearance at the Opposition Dispatch Box  and say that on the Government side  at least  we look forward with relish to his future contributions from that position.,0,0
The board has unusual powers.,0,0
Has the Secretary of State yet replied to Mr. Bernard Barker  the head teacher of the Stanground school  Peterborough  who wrote to him a couple of weeks ago to inform him that in his  Mr. Barker's  opinion  due to the cuts  his school was now breaking section 8 of the Education Act 1944?,0,0
Will he confirm my impression of Dooge that the Government would oppose an intergovernmental conference following Milan?,0,0
We shall move forward  carefully analysing the options that exist and then decide sensibly  in the light of a more certain forecast  what the opportunities should be.,0,0
Is it not a fact that among the many causes of ill health have been the increases in unemployment  increases in homelessness and the abolition of nutritional standards for school meals?,0,0
I believe that they are important for ensuring the future of the railway system.,0,0
Since the tribunals' recommended allocations of secondary quota are being scaled down by 42.5 per cent.,0,0
I stress that NACAB is funded in full for the first six months of this year that is to September so its work can be maintained.,0,0
His jurisdiction is in no sense ousted by the existence of a parallel jurisdiction over parts of the matter by a mental health review tribunal.,0,0
I am not sure to which part of the Scottish Office budget the hon. Gentleman refers.,0,0
He seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that over the last decade the Soviet Union has developed a range of cruise missiles capable of being launched from ground  sea or air.,1,2
I ask him to take a personal interest along with my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for the Environment  who played an extremely constructive and helpful role during a rather difficult period.,1,1
We can rejoice privately when we think that we are doing a little better than we were  but we should all realise the dangers.,0,0
Is it not interesting that all this pressure for new housing development is in the south  not in the north?,0,0
I announced details of my proposals for the 1987 88 rate support grant settlement to the House yesterday.,0,0
I commend it to every hon. Member.,0,0
On a point of order  Mr. Speaker.,0,0
I asked BR to accelerate the economies which BR identified that it could make.,0,0
The location of troops in East Germany is obviously an issue  but the location of Germany in NATO is important.,0,0
The employers and employees should negotiate those matters and there should be no imposition from above.,0,0
It is to be protected by a share structure as antiquated as that of the Savoy.,0,0
The security forces will continue to deal vigorously with all those who break the law in any way.,0,0
Some counties that are run impeccably well by the finest Conservative councillors do not benefit from the proposals that I am putting forward.,0,0
Subsequent to that decision  new information has become available indicating that there is a potential excess expenditure on capital account on one of the housing cash limits.,0,0
He is exactly right.,1,1
over this year's budgets.,0,0
Secondly  the Government will also be seeking powers to privatise the British Gas Corporation's substantial offshore oil business.,0,0
The hon. Gentleman answered in terms of last year.,0,0
The site fully qualifies for scheduling under the National Heritage Act 1983  as the Secretary of State is aware.,0,0
This needs to be seen in the context of the Government's overall plans for privatisation and competition in the oil and gas industries.,0,0
Does the Secretary of State believe that the Wytch field would have been developed earlier  or at all  if the proposals that he has now made had been implemented a decade ago?,0,0
The hon. Gentleman is holding in his hand the document in which we set out the details of how the services will be devolved to the lower  democratically elected tier of government.,0,0
As the tribunal did not so direct  the Minister is in breach of the Act.,1,2
There is general agreement and recognition of the importance and value of NATO and of stationed forces  which was re emphasised by President Bush in his commitment to the American presence in Europe.,0,0
The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that English Heritage has recommended scheduling.,1,2
There has been a Back Bench rebellion by his hon. Friends which has resulted in the Secretary of State rethinking how he can fiddle the system to enable him to take moneys away from Labour authorities to give them to authorities in Tory marginal seats.,1,2
It is clear that law and order have broken down and that the territorial integrity of the New Hebrides has been breached.,0,0
Those documents form a vital basis for what is being proposed at the Heads of Government summit later this week.,0,0
We have several schemes in hand  and there was a good increase in recruitment last year.,0,0
The House is worried about that point.,0,0
I am mindful of this point  but I am also mindful of the need to examine the qualifications of people who set themselves up as liquidators.,0,0
asked the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations have been made to the South African Government following their decision unilaterally to establish a transitional Government in Namibia.,0,0
It is an entirely legitimate use of the power of the House to protest and to make the kind of remark that the hon. Gentleman has made  because there is some chance that the people who are running Romania may listen.,1,1
As it is now seven months since the Chancellor's incentive Budget  does he yet detect any signs of industrial revival resulting from those incentives?,0,0
It is not possible to identify how many were of foreign manufacture.,0,0
Two thirds of nursery provision comes in inner city and urban areas where there is social and economic deprivation.,0,0
One of the qualities of the House of Commons is its capacity to accommodate the separate need for Scottish legislation quickly and effectively.,0,0
With the impending Christmas season  would it not be a nice Christmas present for parents  teachers  children and Scottish education generally if he were to concede that request?,1,2
I cannot offhand give the figures for this year and last year  but we have had great successes in recent days  especially with explosives  which  perhaps more than anything  are causing us great concern.,0,0
That structure was given tremendous impetus by the IAC report.,0,0
Does he anticipate having blitzkriegs in those countries and using short range and medium range nuclear weapons on them?,0,0
Instead of taking comfort in safety regulations  would it not be preferable to recognise that the wrong decision was made about gas?,0,0
As that obviously very much affects the calculation upon which he has based Newham's rate capping  it means that less agreement can be reached in favour of Newham.,0,0
I shall make up my mind as to the final settlement when I have listened to consultations that may be received on the proposals that I am announcing this afternoon.,0,0
There is a grant from the Department of less than  å£8 million  which is unfair to the ratepayers and travellers of west Yorkshire.,0,0
For the reasons that my right hon. and learned Friend gave  the proposition advanced by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is strange because he knows that the Secretary of State still has the jurisdiction that he has always had and is accountable to the House for the exercise of that jurisdiction.,1,2
We must think carefully before we seek to transfer responsibility to the European Community.,0,0
Have new financial targets yet been agreed with British Rail?,0,0
I thought that that was a splendid example of the Minister's logical thought processes.,1,2
Will the Minister recognise that in South Africa there is a growing opinion among whites that the ANC must be involved in negotiations about the future of that country?,0,0
Since the schemes are justifiable on their own merits because they benefit producers and consumers  will the Minister resist any attempt to use the retention of the schemes as a lever to get unjust padding in other parts of the common agricultural policy  under which too much subsidy is already paid?,0,0
Is he aware that almost every section of the community in Scotland is angry about implementation of the poll tax and that both the business community and the Church have been alienated from the Conservatives?,1,2
The latest returns of local authority expenditure between April and June  the more recent HIP submissions for 1981 82  and discussions about them with individual authorities suggest that there could be an overspend of up to å£180 million in 1980 81 above that figure.,0,0
As the right hon. Gentleman only put forward his second proposals in October  and gave local authorities barely three weeks in which to reply  why has he now changed his mind yet again?,1,2
We are always anxious to ensure that benefits are paid speedily once people have qualified for them.,0,0
If positive action is not taken quickly  that could run into thousands.,0,0
However  no decision has been taken on the matter.,0,0
Will he now ensure that the formal and permanent confirmation of Germany's borders with her neighbours is made an urgent and fundamental objective in the two plus four åùnot four plus two åùtalks which will take place in Europe and in other forums where these matters will be discussed?,0,0

We do not want him to be impotent in this instance.,1,2
I think that he will find that this is fairer  for this reason.,0,0
That has included the meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 13 October and the Nuclear Planning Group meeting in Gleneagles on 21 22 October.,0,0
I do not believe that Government intervention is required to produce genuine discussion and negotiation.,0,0
The decision by the Council of Ministers on 28 February to extend the United Kingdom's less favoured areas added 389 600 hectares to the 967 000 hectares originally designated in Wales.,0,0
First  what was done has safeguarded about 190 000 jobs.,0,0
It would not be right to try to abbreviate the statutory procedures and the legal checks on road construction  because many people have an interest in making sure that their views are properly represented.,0,0
I accept my hon. Friend's view that there is a great deal of disgruntlement about the domestic rate system.,0,0
That  therefore  is the correct procedure.,0,0
Will the Minister note the anger and despair felt by the victims of systemisation  one of whom has written to me saying that they must remain silent  and that they feel impotent in the face of this threat?,0,0
My right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary has written to his Romanian counterpart to warn against human rights violations and damage to Europe's common cultural heritage.,0,0

My hon. Friend knows that we have called upon the ANC to renounce violence.,1,2
My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to our enthusiastic support for the completion of the single market  and to our pleasure that this is now broadly following a liberal approach of the sort that we can strongly support.,1,1
In view of the representations received over the years  can my hon. Friend confirm that basic human rights continue to be denied in at least one quarter to one third of Commonwealth member states  including Malaysia  where to convert from Islam to Christianity is punishable and may render the individual open to persecution?,0,0
The consequences that will flow from that are not those suggested by the hon. Gentleman.,1,2
We regret the industrial action which has held up the issue of advance invitations to claim retirement pension and also prevented access to the contribution records used to calculate entitlement to retirement pension in new cases.,0,0
The present external financing limit which covers investment in the railways was put forward by the railways  and we agreed to it.,0,0
It would be most welcome if the Government of South Africa would involve the representatives of all groups of black people in meaningful negotiations in South Africa.,0,0
It is not just in fibres that this is causing difficulty.,0,0
I could give many other illustrations of payments which could not have been covered under the old single payments system.,0,0
If anyone failed to bring harmony it was the Commission  which wholly ignored the instructions of Heads of Government.,0,0
We strongly welcome the outcome of the discussions in Bonn yesterday and the decision of the German Government to accept the need for a treaty with Poland about her frontiers.,0,0
The United States Government made representations at a late stage in the discussions and the formulation that was arrived at was much more liberal than that which was proposed originally  to the extent that considerable embarrassment was caused to the French Government.,0,0
Of course the textile industry places the major part of the blame on the Government for its problems  just as the textile industry placed the major part of the blame on the Labour Government for its problems when the Labour Government were in office.,1,2
If the hon. Gentleman  as a Member of Parliament with every access to information  thinks that that is a proper description of the offer  we are indeed in a bad position.,1,2

Hon. Members will remember the three recent occasions when the question of the New Hebrides has been discussed on the Floor of the House.,0,0
The hon. Gentleman clearly comes new to this subject.,1,2
Frankly  it is an expensive business if one does not comply with one's quota.,0,0
Is it the Secretary of State's intention to set a deliberatly inadequate level of grant related expenditure in order to force many local authorities to spend beyond it and so incur millions of pounds worth of loss of grant?,1,2
We will discuss details with the profession.,0,0
It is to that end that the United States led negotiations have been and continue to be directed åùnot helped by the recent incident  which we all deplored  at Cabinda.,0,0
Order.,0,0
As the incentive to purchase a council house depends largely upon the person wishing to buy in an area where he has respectably behaved neighbours  will my hon. Friend assure us that  in spite of anything else he does  especially in the tenants' charter  he will do nothing which will make it more difficult for local governments to deal with antisocial tenants?,0,0
My right hon. Friend will be aware of my interest as a member of the Theatres Trust  which sought to exert a moderating influence in arguments that at one stage were getting a bit frenzied.,0,0

It is interesting to note that Britain is the first country to contribute in full to the $75 billion of the general capital income increase in resources for lending to middle income debtors.,0,0
Indeed  the hon. Gentleman has put a novel proposition to the House.,1,2
Those economies do not consist of a reduction in quality  the number of services or in a programme of major route closures.,0,0
This is enabling legislation.,0,0

The hon. Gentleman will know that we are to enter into negotiations  but these have not yet begun.,0,0

Reverting to the original question  is my hon. Friend aware of the number of students registered with phoney colleges who are illegally in this country?,0,0
As I understand the present position  five trains will be cancelled on that line only on Saturdays  and only in the winter months as a means of saving fuel.,0,0

First  it is a pity that the hon. Gentleman was not here on 28 June 1990 when he might have caught your eye  Mr. Speaker  during the statement made by my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.,1,2
In addition  we will seek to negotiate the payment of the basic practice allowances depending on a doctor carrying out health promotion and prevention of ill health activities.,0,0

That is recognised by virtually every Government and party in the Alliance  save that to which the hon. Gentleman has the misfortune to belong.,1,2
The total amount of overspend involved there is about å£415 million.,0,0
It would be physically impossible for them to be so  bearing in mind the pressure on the Department's local offices  which are seeking to respond and to ensure that payments are made available to all those who  because of the industrial action taken by a few people in the Department  are without their rightful entitlement  ,0,0
Is it not the simple truth that the Government are making the country sick?,1,2

off milk producers' primary quotas  but the unions told me that they did not have a better figure than 2.5 per cent.,0,0

We further agreed that the authority of the legitimate Government must be restored on the island of Santo as soon as possible  and condemned the actions of those responsible for the armed insurrection on the island.,0,0

My hon. Friend is correct.,1,1
We have created far more jobs in the United Kingdom over recent years than any of our European partners.,0,0

I remind my hon. Friend that there is no ban on production outside quotas.,0,0

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on levels of unemployment in Clwyd and north Wales generally.,0,0
I listened to what the hon.

However  I hope that the time will very soon come when we are able to do it.,0,0
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales when he next intends to meet the chairman of the area health authorities in Wales to discuss the Government's national health service reforms.,0,0
This was reaffirmed on 23 December  in the light of the statement that day by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers about the proposed BP offer for Britoil.,0,0

Unemployment in Britain has fallen for 33 consecutive months  and the number of jobs created between June 1983 and June 1987 the last period for which records are available is larger than that in the whole of the rest of the Community put together  for exactly the reasons that my hon. Friend has given.,1,1
The hon. Member must be aware that both my right hon. Friend and I fully realise the problems facing ratepayers in Scotland  as shown in the action that we took this year in increasing domestic rate relief eightfold  from ÌÄ‰Û_Ìâå£14 million to ÌÄ‰Û_Ìâå£102 million.,0,0

Capital expenditure is very important and  happily  is increasing.,0,0
Is the Minister aware that many producers  particularly those undertaking development plans  will have a rude shock at the end of March when they find that their quota is 30 percent less than they had bargained for?,0,0
At the risk of making the Minister's next meeting with the chairman a very long one  may I ask him also to raise with the chairman the forecasts which make it plain that within the next few months British Rail will go through the ceiling on the public service obligation grant and that the figures for future years are unrealistic?,0,0
Does my right hon. Friend remember that some nine months ago he committed himself to sort out the situation as soon as possible?,1,2

Is not the reality that few people in Wales support the so called reforms?,0,0
Is there any reason why he uses that particular form of words?,1,2
The reality for 10 years has been that  despite the increase to which I referred  and despite the happy increase in patient activity  London's population has fallen and its relative overprovision  as seen by the then Labour Government  has produced a pattern of acute bed reductions  which has continued ever since that period on roughly the same basis.,1,2

This is the only way in which a longterm reduction in unemployment can be achieved.,0,0
Secondly  will he look again at his responsibilities under the 1983 Act?,0,0
I know of no such evidence about the CIA as the hon. Gentleman mentions.,0,0
Is that because the Chancellor of the Exchequer has told the Secretary of State that that will allow a half penny in the pound to come off income tax  or is it because the Secretary of State will make sure that the money lost will be put hack into the kitty and the Government will not suffer a net loss  despite the announcement made yesterday?,0,0
We must consider any changes in clear consultation with all the members of NATO to ensure that effective security is maintained  and the Americans are an extremely important partner in that.,0,0
As the Chancellor of the Exchequer  rightly or wrongly  has been saddled with this very controversial  but highly undemocratic  power  would it be sensitive to the national interest far him to seek the views of those bidding for Britoil as to whether they intend to support regional development and maintain the centre of the company in Glasgow?,1,2
male unemployment in Flint?,0,0
I see the Minister nodding.,0,0

It is not true that fewer aircraft are defending us.,0,0
We hope that this happens soon.,0,0

Rates are shooting up by the 80 per cent.,0,0
Does he think that it is any accident that the bulk of the targeting action is directed against children who go to schools in the constituencies of Conservative Members of Parliament?,0,0

I congratulate the Minister on his first appearance at the Dispatch Box in his present role.,0,0
I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the fact that now everybody else is in step with us åùexcept  apparently  the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson).,1,2

However  it is  of course  important to maintain pressure in the most effective way that we possibly can.,0,0
I hope he recognises  as his hon. Friends showed they recognised in their supplementary questions to the first question today  that the position in Northern Ireland  although a very long way from being normal  is a lot better than it was.,0,0
Not only would the creation of an Assembly of the kind proposed by the Labour party inevitably lead to a reduction in Scottish representation in the House of Commons  but one is entitled to assume that the achievement of what could be called Scottish home rule would lead inevitably to an expectation and requirement for English home rule.,0,0
Are not the Government capitulating to every demand of the Common Market  including the payment of å£4.7 billion since 1984 and the development of a trade deficit in manufactured goods of å£10 billion?,1,2
The Chancellor's answer to an earlier question about the siting of Britoil's headquarters was staggering in its indifference.,1,2
He might also like to address his mind to two other matters.,0,0

That shortage will be ended.,0,0
Lord Crickhowell and my immediate predecessor  my right hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker)  laid a tremendous foundation for the future prosperity of Wales.,1,1
With the exception of Italy  which in fact has a particular derogation until the end of the quota year  my own feeling is a good deal more optimistic than it was that other member states are implementing the rules.,0,0
It is not possible at this stage to do other than make assumptions which may or may not be justified.,0,0
The chairman accepts that it is important I believe that this is common policy on both sides of the House that British Rail's freight operations should run at a break even point.,0,0

That is why the right hon. Gentleman has no control over them.,1,2
Is it not clear that the Labour party's opposition to such matters is limited to making a lot of noise during the day?,0,0

Or is it simply to be allowed to sink?,0,0
Development of the air defence variant of the Tornado  with its powerful airborne intercept radar  continues  as does that of the very advanced Nimrod airborne early warning aircraft which will replace the Shackleton.,0,0
That means that British Rail Engineering Limited will have to tender effectively if it wants to gain the contract.,0,0
Indeed  the right hon. Member for Leeds  East (Mr. Healey)  the former Chancellor of the Exchequer  found it necessary in 1976 to take similar action  and he was supported by the right hon. Member for Manchester  Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman).,1,1
I do not see how one can gerrymander in favour of one's political opponents.,0,0

Most rational people who try to approach the health of the nation with a sense of rationality and balance will understand the political hypocrisy behind that question.,0,0
