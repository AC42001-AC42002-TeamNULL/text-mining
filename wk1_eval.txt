Realistically the results aren't conclusive as it shows that sentiment analysis vastly outperforms machine learning,
the classifier reports a self accuracy of roughly ~38%, but the sentiment analyser correctly guesses in 61% of cases,
however this is due to a variety of contributors, mainly small and limited data set. Yet these are great results with
such limited data.

Sentiment analysis is easier to perform, requiring only the text where as machine learning the data has to be constructed
into feature sets for the NLTK package. However sentiment analysis when examining compound scores requires
manual adjusting of weighting which could skew results in one direction or another if poor weights are chosen.

Ultimately, for machine learning in this case a supervised learning method, the more ground truth data you have to train
with the better the results, but sentiment analysis we can see is still a good method to gather sentiment on sentences with
relatively good performance.
