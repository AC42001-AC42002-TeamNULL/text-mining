In a rules-based approach to argument mining, we aim to extrapolate information about an argument based upon rules
we know about arguments, such as how they are structured.

Rule based approaches as some of the provided material states can be a good measure for argument mining however,
rule based approaches incurs some precursor knowledge and a sample data set which allows for argument processing. For example,
Twitter data is typically unsuited without postprocessing to grab the root tweet and related argument chains which might span multiple
users and parse argument structure such that arguments are aligned and matched to the associated user.

In this instance we used Amazon review data which are self-contained units and can be processed independent of other reviews.
For this we decided to approach each argument structure by segmenting based on verb usage as our rule. Since we are only
interested in something a user had experienced which would typically be expressed using a verb indicator. This is a broad approach as
not every verb is a good indicator and could provide more or less random results on some datasets.

This is a downside to rule based approaches, as using something like REGEX you can parse arguments on particular discourse markers
which have strong indicators for argument structure for example: if, so, but, first. However this can lead to loss of information
if proper grammar and spelling aren't maintained, eg. 1st vs first. Additionally, this is a manual process and requires additional
background knowledge on the dataset to accurately formulate expected rules for extracting arguments and their structure.

This downside though can be huge positive, the most prominent advantage of a rule-based approach in argument mining is
that rule-based approaches are typically able to provide strong results when fine-tuned to a very specific domain.
Thus, when we find a rule that applies to a vast majority of arguments, we can utilise this to capture
a very large amount of arguments. The disadvantage of this however is that we may require many rules in order to filter
out other pieces of discourse for which those rules also apply.

Another advantage is that rules-based approaches can be performed in an unsupervised manner,
with the rules doing all the work without requiring any time-consuming prior labelling of the data.
However, a lot of time effort will still be expended implementing and fine-tweaking rules.

In conclusion, rule based approaches are time and work intensive but can offer a large increase in accuracy as rules can be fine
tuned to the needs of the application being developed. The greatest limitation to the rules-based approach is its lack
of flexibility compared to other approaches such as semi-supervised or unsupervised machine learning.
A machine learning based argument miner may become very accurate and possibly surpass a rules-based
approach when exposed to a large amount of training examples, and may draw on examples from many domains giving
the approach a total underlying understanding of rules without the fine-tuning and research requirement
of a rules based approach.
